# ft_containers_main
Main.cpp to test project ft_containers.

Mostly contains tests from cppreference.com but also added some custom tests to make sure classes are well designed.
GL HF. 

DO NOT PUSH THIS AS YOUR MAIN.CPP FOR THE PROJECT !

# Usage notes
* You might have to change include path to your .hpp
* If you named your containers in lowercase, change the container type name in tester. 
  Ex : ft::Vector -> ft::vector
